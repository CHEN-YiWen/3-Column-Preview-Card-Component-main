## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

- I still need to figure out how to center the whole container in the page. now I use a stupid way to make it looks like it is in the middle of the page.
```css
main{
    display: flex;
    margin: auto;
    padding: 30px 0px 20px 0px;
}
```
